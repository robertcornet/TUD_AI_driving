# Vehicle motion simulator

The simulator can be used to develop and test your controllers. From the two inputs (Steering and Throttle), it will approximate how the car would behave. The simulator is built in the [OpenAI GYM](https://gym.openai.com/) structure.

The simulator is used in combination with the Reinforcement Learning programs from the [RLControlTheoreticGuarantee Github](https://github.com/RLControlTheoreticGuarantee/Guarantee_Learning_Control). 

Inluded on this page is a folder with an older copy of that github, including the vehicle simulator. 
If you follow their installation guide, you can download the folder above and start training immediately.


## Using the simulator
- Define your objective and what states you can observe in your experiment. Make sure your controller does not rely on states that you can not observe in the real world!
- Choose the time step for the agent (eg, 10 hz, 25hz, etc). The vehicle simulation updates at 1000hz for stable integration. 
- Define how you want an episode to start (*def reset()*) and when to end (*done*)
- Construct your reward so it promotes the desired behaviour


## States
In the simulator you have access to the following vehicle states:

- longitudinal velocity *u*
- lateral velocity *v*
- yaw rate *r*
- longitudinal acceleration *a<sub>x</sub>*
- lateral acceleration *a<sub>y</sub>*
- wheel rotation velocities *Î©* (4x)

Additionally, you can simulate what ultrasonic sensors would detect in different scenarios:
- detecting room/racetrack borders (lidar)
- single object detection (eg. determining distance to leading car)


## Primary Simulator Functions
The most important functions are:

*def* \_\_init\_\_()
Here all the parameters are set for the car and the environment. For example, here you would change the mass, the dimensions, or the motor characteristics of the car.

def reset ()
This function is called at the beginning of every training episode. It (re)sets the parameters for the episode. Here you can set how and where your vehicle starts in the environment. It can also be used to build a different enviroment for every episode.

def step()
This is the main simulation function. It takes two inputs (steering and throttle), and runs the simulation for one step in the environment.  
It returns the new state of the car and environment, and a reward based on that state. 






## Secondary Simulator functions

## SIMULATING LIDAR

The simulator supports simulating lidar behaviour in a few different ways.

1,2: Ray Tracing
tracing each ray and determining the distance to the nearest wall-line segment.
A wall-line can be:
1. left/right wall of the track.
2. the walls of a room

This methond only measures the distance in the center of the FOV of the sensor.

3, FOV:
determining the distance between the car and an object, and triggering all sensors for which that object is in its FOV. 
This is used to detect the leading car, in case of car following

## Electronic Speed Control

The ESC puts out a voltage to the motor depending on the input signal. 
The input is a PWM signal with pulses between 1000us (full throttle) and 2000us (full braking).
This behaviour is modelled in the simulator as a voltage multiplier; the ESC acts as a multiplier in range [0-1] between the battery voltage and motor.
For the TBLE-02S ESC included in the Tamiya kit, the following values were measured:


|Throttle %|Voltage Mult.|
|---|---|
|0|0|
|7.5|0|
|7.6|0.44|
|10|0.53|
|20|0.75|
|30|0.84|
|40|0.89|
|50|0.94|
|60|0.96|
|70|1|
|80|1|
|90|1|
|100|1|

## The Motor
Tamiya specifies a motor KV (RPM per volt) of 2222. Our measurements revealed a KV closer to 2775:
|Voltage|Motor RPM|KV|
|---|---|---|
|3.45|9322|2702|
|4.09|11376|2781|
|5.82|16116|2769|
|6.57|18179|2765|
|6.95|19276|2774|
|7.30|20540|2813|
|7.48|20935|2798|
|7.79|21725|2789|
