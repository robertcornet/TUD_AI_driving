# Software Setup

Install the following software on your Odroid XU-4.

## OS 
Start by installing a Linux image (MATE) on the computer memory. Hardkernel provides the images and a tutorial in their [Odroid Wiki](https://wiki.odroid.com/getting_started/os_installation_guide) 
You will need a Micro SD card reader to connect the memory and its adapter to your PC.

Alternatively, you can buy a memory module with the OS already installed.

## WiFi Drivers
Many USB WiFi dongles are not directly supported on all Linux kernels. If your WiFi module is not working, you likely need to install your drivers manually. For the WiFi module in the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/blob/main/documentation/bill_of_materials.md), use these [drivers](https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bu).
