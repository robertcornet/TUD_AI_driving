## Who is it for?
This platform is for anyone who is interested in vehicle research that goes beyond navigation tasks and focusses on dynamic vehicle behaviour and vehicle stability. The onboard accelerometers, gyros and individual wheel speed sensors provide a good basis for developing impressive vehicle controllers.

## What does it offer?
- Low-cost dynamic driving with access to the relevant vehicle states.
- Small scale suitable for compact spaces
- Onboard TensorFlow integration for AI driving
- Modular platform for easy addition of sensors

## Getting Started
- Order everything you need from the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/blob/main/documentation/bill_of_materials.md) 
- Print the [CAD models](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/tree/main/CAD)
- Assemble your car with the help of the [Build Guide](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/blob/main/documentation/build_guide.md)
- Install the [Software](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/blob/main/documentation/software_setup.md)
- Flash the [code to the Arduinos](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/tree/main/Arduino) 

Your platform should now be ready to begin! 
If you want some extra help, check out the [Operation Manual](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/blob/main/documentation/operation_manual.md). If you want to build a vehicle simulation to train your AI, check out the [Simulator section](https://github.com/robertcornet/TUD_AI_driving/tree/main/Simulator).
