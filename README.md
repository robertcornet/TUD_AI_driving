# TU Delft AI driving platform

# Introduction
This page contains all information regarding the TU Delft AI driving platform. It is designed for the department of Cognitive Robotics (CoR) at the faculty of 3ME at the TU Delft.

## Who is it for?
This platform is for anyone who is interested in vehicle research that goes beyond navigation tasks and focusses on dynamic vehicle behaviour and vehicle stability. The onboard accelerometers, gyros and individual wheel speed sensors provide a good basis for developing impressive vehicle controllers.

## What does it offer?
- low-cost dynamic driving with access to the relevant vehicle states.
- small scale suitable for compact spaces
- Onboard TensorFlow integration for AI driving
- Modular platform for easy addition of sensors
