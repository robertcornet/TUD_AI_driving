# CAD

The STL files in this folder are meant to be 3D printed. Do not forget to cut the threads for the M3 bolt holes!

The main frame is split into two parts (front and rear) so it can be printed with a smaller printbed.

# Expirimental

In the expirimental folder, you can find the parts that will increase the steering angle from 16.5 degrees (standard) to an average of 29 degrees. 
You can only use this if the front driveshafts are removed.
